# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## This project is a comprehensive Crop Recommendation System powered by machine learning techniques. It employs neural networks and logistic regression algorithms to predict the best crops for cultivation based on soil nutrient data. The backend is developed using Python with Flask, which serves the machine learning predictions to the user. The frontend interface is built using HTML and CSS, providing an interactive and user-friendly web experience. This system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions for optimal crop cultivation and yield improvement.
